Free, simple, token-based authentication (Google Authenticator) for your WordPress. No registration needed.

== Description ==

= Secure your WordPress Administration area with 2FAS Light plugin. =

Every time you log in to a WP-admin panel, 2FAS Light plugin checks if the device has already been trusted. In case the device has not been trusted, the user will be asked for a security code generated by Google Authenticator mobile app.

2FAS plugin also works with other mobile applications that generate tokens, such as: Microsoft Authenticator, Authy, Free OTP, 2STP, OTP Auth.

= Get instant protection against: =

= Brute-force attacks =

When undergoing a brute-force attack, your password can be discovered by the attacker. This is the only vulnerability you will experience with 2FAS Light. 2FAS's Light intelligent security feature provides a finite amount of time in which the attacker access the correct token. After the access period has ended, the attacker is locked out for security reasons.

= WordPress takeovers =

Many people use the same password or a similar password for many online services. Repeatedly used passwords remain are vulnerable in cyberspace. Using the 2FAS Light plugin on your WordPress site makes access without a 2FAS Light registered device very difficult.

= Phishing and keylogger attacks =

If you're not completely sure that the devices used by you or your subusers are completely free of keyloggers and viruses, then using 2FAS Light to protect your WordPress site from security breaches is a great solution!

Any password discovery attempt is useless with 2FAS Light. Without the token generated by your 2FAS Light, conventional access to your WordPress site is almost impossible.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why do I need the 2FAS Light plugin? =

If you're not completely sure your devices or ones used by your sub-users are completely free of keyloggers and viruses, then it is a great solution.
Without the token generated by your smartphone, any password discovery attempt will be useless with 2FAS Light plugin.

= Do I need to enter a token each time I log in to the WordPress admin? =

No, it is not necessary. The 2FAS Light plugin determines whether or not the user is required to enter a token as an additional form of authentication.

= What do I need to do to start using the 2FAS Light plugin? =

The most common way to use the 2FAS Light plugin is to configure your smartphone to generate tokens. You can download any Time-based One-time Password (TOTP) app (e.g. Google Authenticator, Authy, FreeOTP, etc.).

= Can I use a browser extension instead of my smartphone to generate tokens? =

Yes, you can; however, it isn't as safe as using your smartphone.
The main idea of the two-factor authentication is based on using different devices or channels, which can verify a user. When you are using a browser extension, then you are not protected from malware or viruses, which can catch your token.

= Is it free? =

Yes, it is completely free.
You can either use it privately or for commercial usage without any fees.

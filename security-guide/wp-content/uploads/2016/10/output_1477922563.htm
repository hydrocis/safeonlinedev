        <p> Published Date : September 7, 2016<br />Author : tayo<br /><p style="text-align: justify;"><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="http://deepbluesky.com/images/sized/600x/e67da65af4-qx90.png" alt="" width="600" height="264" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Privacy policy</strong> is the statement or a legal document that discloses how customer data is managed and used. It can be hard to understand, seeming to be meaningful to just the writers or someone in the advertising industry. Many people do not actually read privacy policy either because it is too long or they don’t just care.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The major challenge lies in helping people to realize why the privacy of their data is important to them, and then enabling techniques on assisting them to understand the unending data policy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Several issues contribute to confusion over privacy policies, beginning with the assumptions users make about what it means to have a privacy policy in the first place. Many people don’t actually read privacy policies; they simply look at the label. And the intuitive understanding — the cultural understanding — of the label is that when something says privacy policy, it protects your privacy .</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Users don’t fully understand the scope of the data that is being collected on them — or how small amounts of data can be used to create a much more detailed portrait when matched with information from third-party sites that collect and share various types of customer information with each other. The general sense among marketers is that people understand that their data is being used, but people don’t truly understand how data mining works. They may realize that one or two pieces of their information are being given out; what they don’t realize is that those one or two data points can be linked with other sources to uncover information they would have never given out in the first place.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Approach to Understanding</strong><br />
Endeavour to Read the End User License Agreement and Privacy Policy or Data Use Policy carefully, this will let you understand how your content and personal data are going to be treated, with whom will they be shared. The sort of service that you are signing up to can give a general idea of what kind of personal data will be collected from you and if you will be to ok to have such data shared with a third party entity other than the service provider you are transacting with. In fact, it has been reported that if you actually bothered to read all the privacy policies you encounter on a daily basis, it would take you 250 working hours per year &#8212; or about 30 workdays.</p>

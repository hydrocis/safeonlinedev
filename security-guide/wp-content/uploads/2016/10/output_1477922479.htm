        <p> Published Date : September 7, 2016<br />Author : tayo<br /><p>You got an email saying that your email account has just been blocked and you need to login to verify some information before you can gain access back. You noticed that website looks just exactly like the real website but your instincts tells you that this is a fake website.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://media2.govtech.com/images/Phishing.jpg" width="587" height="391" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Phishing</b> is the attempt to obtain sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, and credit card details (and sometimes, indirectly, money), often for malicious reasons, by masquerading as a trustworthy entity in an electronic communication.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Just below is an example of a Phishing email:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-375 size-large" src="http://178.62.60.23/wordpress/security-guide/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/gone-phishing-again-700x266.png" alt="gone-phishing-again" width="700" height="266" srcset="http://178.62.60.23/wordpress/security-guide/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/gone-phishing-again-700x266.png 700w, http://178.62.60.23/wordpress/security-guide/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/gone-phishing-again-250x95.png 250w, http://178.62.60.23/wordpress/security-guide/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/gone-phishing-again-768x291.png 768w, http://178.62.60.23/wordpress/security-guide/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/gone-phishing-again-120x46.png 120w, http://178.62.60.23/wordpress/security-guide/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/gone-phishing-again.png 1104w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a general rule, you should be careful about giving out your personal financial information over the Internet.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are some steps you can take to avoid becoming a victim:</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Be suspicious of any email or communication (including text messages, social media post, ads) with <strong>urgent requests</strong> for personal <strong>financial information</strong>.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>AVOID</strong> clicking on links. Instead, go to the website by typing the Web address directly into your browser or by searching for it in a search engine. Calling the company to verify its legitimacy is also an option, too</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Don’t send personal financial information via email, and avoid filling out forms in email that ask for your information.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Use a secure website <strong>(https:// and a security “lock” icon)</strong> when submitting credit card or other sensitive information online. A secure website always start with <strong>&#8216;https://&#8217;</strong>.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Never use public, unsecured WiFi for banking, shopping or entering personal information online, even if the website is secure.<br />
</span></li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Double-clicking the “lock” icon on a website will display the security certificate for the website. If the certificate isn’t displayed, or you get a warning message that the address of the website does not match the certificate, do not continue.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Typically, phisher emails are not personalized, but they can be. Valid messages from your bank and e-commerce companies are personalized, and addressed specifically to you. When in doubt, call the company directly to see if the email is in fact from them.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Phishers have the ability to spoof and/or forge the https:// that you normally see on a secure Web server and a legitimate-looking Web address, which – again – is why you should <strong>always type the web address yourself instead of clicking</strong> on displayed links.</span></li>
</ol>

        <hr />        <h1> Protect Yourself from an Unsafe Website </h1>
        <p> Published Date : September 7, 2016<br />Author : tayo<br /><p style="text-align: justify;"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-405 size-large" src="http://178.62.60.23/wordpress/security-guide/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/google-unsafe-warning-700x513.png" alt="google-unsafe-warning" width="700" height="513" srcset="http://178.62.60.23/wordpress/security-guide/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/google-unsafe-warning-700x513.png 700w, http://178.62.60.23/wordpress/security-guide/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/google-unsafe-warning-250x183.png 250w, http://178.62.60.23/wordpress/security-guide/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/google-unsafe-warning-768x563.png 768w, http://178.62.60.23/wordpress/security-guide/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/google-unsafe-warning-120x88.png 120w, http://178.62.60.23/wordpress/security-guide/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/google-unsafe-warning.png 843w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">With more people storing personal information on their computers, it has never been more important to protect yourself from internet predators looking to gain access to your files. One of the many ways they can do this is by attacking your computer or trying to gather your information from an infected or malicious website you may visit, even if only once. The best thing you can do is to avoid malicious websites altogether</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are the most prevalent tell-tale signs of a threatening website and some ways that you can protect yourself:</span></p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Never click on a link embedded in an email. Even if sent from someone you trust, always type the link into your browser</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use your common sense. Does a website look strange to you? Is it asking for sensitive personal information? If it looks unsafe, don’t take the risk.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Look for signs of legitimacy. Does the website list contact information or some signs of a real-world presence. If doubtful, contact them by phone or email to establish their legitimacy.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Read the URL carefully. If this is a website you frequent, is the URL spelled correctly? Often times, phishers will set up websites almost identical to the spelling of the site you are trying to visit. An accidental mistype may lead you to a fraudulent version of the site.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If it looks too good to be true, it probably is. Is the website offering you a product or service at an unheard of price? Or maybe they are promising you a huge return on investment? If the offer looks too good to be true, trust your instincts. Do some research to find reviews or warnings from other users.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Check the properties of any links. Right-clicking a hyperlink and selecting “Properties” will reveal the true destination of the link. Does it look different from what it claimed to lead you to?</span></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You should also always be on the lookout for the clues and telltale hints that you are on a malicious website.  After all, it is by smart people noticing something wrong and reporting it that the above tools can do their job.</span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><b>Things to look for in a secure website</b></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When visiting a website that asks for sensitive information such as credit card numbers or your social security number, the first step you can take to securing your privacy is creating a strong password (link to infosec site). Equally important is verifying that any information you enter on this site is transmitted and stored properly. Once your information is entered online, it is transmitted as plain text for anyone to intercept. To avoid this, make sure that the website is encrypted over a secure connection.</span></p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HTTPS</span></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">One such sign to look for is in the URL of the website. A secure website’s URL should begin with “https” rather than “http”. The “s” at the end of “http” stands for secure and is using an SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) connection. Your information will be encrypted before being sent to a server.</span></p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">THE LOCK ICON</span></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another sign to look for is the “Lock” icon that is displayed somewhere in the window of your web </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">browser. Different browsers may position the lock in different places, but a few examples of what it may look like can be found here:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class="size-medium wp-image-426 alignleft" src="http://178.62.60.23/wordpress/security-guide/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/https-ranking-signal-02-250x77.png" alt="https-ranking-signal-02" srcset="http://178.62.60.23/wordpress/security-guide/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/https-ranking-signal-02-250x77.png 250w, http://178.62.60.23/wordpress/security-guide/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/https-ranking-signal-02-120x37.png 120w, http://178.62.60.23/wordpress/security-guide/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/https-ranking-signal-02.png 355w" sizes="(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Google Chrome</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clicking on the Lock icon will give you detailed information on the security status of this website</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Mozilla Firefox</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Firefox, the Lock icon may not be displayed directly. Clicking on the site&#8217;s icon next to the URL should reveal the Lock icon and the secure verification</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Internet Explorer</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clicking on the Lock icon will give you detailed information on the security status of this website</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Be sure to click on the “lock” icon to verify that a website is trustworthy. Do not simply look for the icon and assume a website is secure! Your web browser will have detailed information on the website’s authenticity if you click on the icon, so be sure to read this carefully before entering any of your information on the site.</span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><b>Protect Yourself</b></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Utilize your internet browser’s security tools</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Be sure to install the most current version of your web browser. Most browsers have sophisticated filters that can identify and warn you of potential security threats.

        <hr />        <h1> How to Protect Your Computer </h1>
        <p> Published Date : September 7, 2016<br />Author : tayo<br /><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Below are some key steps to protecting your computer from intrusion</em></strong></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><b>Keep Your Firewall Turned On</b></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A firewall helps protect your computer from hackers who might try to gain access to crash it, delete information, or even steal passwords or other sensitive information. Software firewalls are widely recommended for single computers. </span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;">Turn On Firewall on Windows</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="http://www.digitalcitizen.life/sites/default/files/img/win_firewall/windows_firewall7.png" alt="" width="468" height="325" /></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;">Turn On Firewall on Mac OS</h4>
<p><img class="aligncenter " src="https://cdn.igeeksblog.com/wp-content/uploads/Click-on-Firewall-in-Mac-OS-X-System-Preferences.jpg" alt="" width="481" height="392" /></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"></h3>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><b> Install or Update Your Antivirus Software</b></h4>
<p>Antivirus software is designed to prevent malicious software programs from embedding on your computer. If it detects malicious code, like a virus or a worm, it works to disarm or remove it. Viruses can infect computers without users’ knowledge. Most types of antivirus software can be set up to update automatically.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class="aligncenter " src="https://encrypted-tbn1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQdwDNgj4nowGKnFcj2PZvEch7M0Tqj3LBAsaZ5D3_-PBHyp1pG" alt="" width="299" height="190" /></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Install or Update Your Antispyware Technology:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Spyware is just what it sounds like—software that is surreptitiously installed on your computer to let others peer into your activities on the computer. Some spyware collects information about you without your consent or produces unwanted pop-up ads on your web browser. Some operating systems offer free spyware protection, and inexpensive software is readily available for download on the Internet or at your local computer store. Be wary of ads on the Internet offering downloadable antispyware—in some cases these products may be fake and may actually contain spyware or other malicious code. It’s like buying groceries—shop where you trust.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Keep Your Operating System Up to Date</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Computer operating systems are periodically updated to stay in tune with technology requirements and to fix security holes. Be sure to install the updates to ensure your computer has the latest protection.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Be Careful What You Download</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carelessly downloading e-mail attachments or software from pop-ups online can circumvent even the most vigilant anti-virus software. Never open an e-mail attachment from someone you don’t know, and be wary of forwarded attachments from people you do know. They may have unwittingly advanced malicious code.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class="aligncenter " src="http://blog.teesupport.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/myfreekidsmeal.png" alt="" width="500" height="366" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Turn Off Your Computer</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the growth of high-speed Internet connections, many opt to leave their computers on and ready for action. The downside is that being “always on” renders computers more susceptible.</span></p>

        <hr />        <h1> Guide to Secure your Online Browsing: Chrome, Firefox and Internet Explorer </h1>
        <p> Published Date : September 7, 2016<br />Author : tayo<br /><h1 style="text-align: justify;"><b>Secure your web browser: Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome</b></h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since we use our browser for most of our online activities, it is important to know how to configure it correctly.  Not securing our browser, may result in attacks on our computers.<br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though we can not guarantee complete safety from malware attempts and online attacks, we know that following the steps below will increase your web browser security. At the same time, we can not name one single browser as the best possible selection for a user, since so many studies and articles name one over the other. For this reason, we will simply choose to present the 3 most popular web browsers for Windows: Google Chrome, Internet Explorer and Mozilla Firefox.</span></p>
<h3>Tips for Secure Browsing with Microsoft Internet Explorer 10</h3>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-334" src="http://178.62.60.23/wordpress/security-guide/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/internet-explorer-privacy.jpg" alt="internet-explorer-privacy" srcset="http://178.62.60.23/wordpress/security-guide/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/internet-explorer-privacy.jpg 200w, http://178.62.60.23/wordpress/security-guide/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/internet-explorer-privacy-150x150.jpg 150w, http://178.62.60.23/wordpress/security-guide/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/internet-explorer-privacy-120x120.jpg 120w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" /></p>
<p>These settings can be accessed through the “Internet Options” menu.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Configure security settings:</strong> Under the “Security” tab, do the following:
<ul>
<li><em>Set security zones:</em> IE offers the option to configure different security settings for different “zones,” including the Internet, local intranet, trusted sites, and restricted sites. Set up the zones for Intranet, Trusted Sites, and Restricted sites to your desired security level.</li>
<li>Set Internet zone security to “Medium High” or higher. This blocks certain cookie types, enables ActiveX filtering, and implements several other default settings for increased security.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Automatically clear history:</strong> Select “Delete browsing history on exit” under the “General” tab. Clearing your history at the end of each session helps to limit the amount of information IE saves when you browse.</li>
<li><strong>Configure privacy settings:</strong> Under the “Privacy” tab, complete the following steps:
<ul>
<li><em>Privacy setting:</em> Set the Internet zone privacy to “Medium High” or higher. This blocks certain cookie types to prevent sites from tracking or contacting you without your consent.</li>
<li><em>Location:</em> Select “Never allow websites to request your physical location.”</li>
<li><em>Pop-up Blocker:</em> Double check that Pop-up Blocker is enabled.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Configure Advanced Security settings:</strong> Scroll down to the “Security” section under the “Advanced” tab and do the following:
<ul>
<li>Ensure that all default settings are in place. If you aren’t sure, click “Restore advanced settings” before making any other changes.</li>
<li>Select “Do not save encrypted pages to disk.” This will delete files cached from HTTPS pages when the browser is closed.</li>
<li>Select “Empty Temporary Internet Files folder when browser is closed.” This prevents IE from storing your personal info (logins, passwords, activity, etc) beyond your browsing session.</li>
<li><em>Turn off autoComplete:</em> The AutoComplete feature should be turned off for forms and usernames/passwords. Keeping AutoComplete turned off ensures that your sensitive information isn’t being stored unnecessarily.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Tracking protection:</strong> IE’s Tracking Protection feature keeps your browsing private from specified third-party websites. This feature can be accessed through IE’s “Safety” menu. In order to use Tracking Protection you will need to provide a Tracking Protection List that names all of the sites you don’t want your information being sent to. You can create a list yourself or download lists online.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Tips for Secure Browsing with Mozilla Firefox</h3>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-332" src="http://178.62.60.23/wordpress/security-guide/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/firefox-privacy-settings.jpg" alt="firefox-privacy-settings" srcset="http://178.62.60.23/wordpress/security-guide/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/firefox-privacy-settings.jpg 200w, http://178.62.60.23/wordpress/security-guide/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/firefox-privacy-settings-150x150.jpg 150w, http://178.62.60.23/wordpress/security-guide/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/firefox-privacy-settings-120x120.jpg 120w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" />These settings can be accessed through the “Options” menu.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Configure privacy settings:</strong> Under the “Privacy” tab, complete the following steps. These measures ensure that Firefox is storing only as much of your information as it needs to function normally.
<ul>
<li>Select “Use custom settings for history.”</li>
<li>Deselect “Remember my browsing and download history.”</li>
<li>Deselect “Remember search and form history.”</li>
<li>Deselect “Accept third-party cookies.”</li>
<li>Set cookie storage to “Keep until I close Firefox.”</li>
<li>Select “Clear history when Firefox closes.”</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-464 size-full" src="http://178.62.60.23/wordpress/security-guide/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/firefox.png" alt="firefox" width="676" height="633" srcset="http://178.62.60.23/wordpress/security-guide/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/firefox.png 676w, http://178.62.60.23/wordpress/security-guide/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/firefox-250x234.png 250w, http://178.62.60.23/wordpress/security-guide/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/firefox-120x112.png 120w" sizes="(max-width: 676px) 100vw, 676px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Configure security settings:</strong> Under the “Security” tab, choose the following settings. These steps prevent Firefox from saving your passwords and keep you from visiting potentially harmful sites.
<ul>
<li>Verify that “Warn me when sites try to install add-ons,” “Block reported attack sites,” and “Block reported web forgeries” are all selected.</li>
<li>Deselect “Remember passwords for sites.”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Enable pop-up blocking:</strong> Verify that “Block pop-up windows” is selected under the “Content” tab. This feature should be turned on by default as it protects users from unwarranted advertisements and windows.</li>
<li><strong>Don’t sync:</strong> Avoid using Firefox Sync. By doing so you prevent Firefox from storing your logins, passwords, and other sensitive information.</li>
<li><strong>Turn on automatic updates:</strong> Verify that “Automatically install updates” is selected in the “Update” tab under “Advanced.” Doing so will ensure that your browser receives critical security updates. Verify that “Automatically update Search Engines” is selected as well.</li>
<li><strong>Use secure protocols:</strong> Verify that “Use SSL 3.0” and “Use TLS 1.0” are selected in the “Encryption” tab under “Advanced.”</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>Enable phishing and malware protection:</strong> Make sure that Chrome’s phishing and malware protection feature is enabled under the “Privacy” section. This feature will warn you if a site you’re trying to visit may be phishing or contain malware.</li>
<li><strong>Turn off instant search:</strong> The Instant search feature should be turned off for optimal security. While it offers some convenience in searching, having this feature enabled means that anything you type in the address bar is instantly sent to Google.</li>
<li><strong>Don’t sync:</strong> Disconnect your email account from your browser under the “Personal Stuff” tab. Syncing your email account with your Chrome browser means that personal information such as passwords, autofill data, preferences, and more is stored on Google’s servers. If you must use sync, select the “Encrypt all synced data” option and create a unique passphrase for encryption.</li>
<li><strong>Configure content settings:</strong> Click “Content settings” under the “Privacy” section and do the following:
<ul>
<li><em>Cookies:</em> Select “Keep local data only until I quit my browser” and “Block third-party cookies and site data.” These options ensure that your cookies will be deleted upon quitting Chrome and that advertisers will not be able to track you using third-party cookies.</li>
<li><em>Pop-ups:</em> Select “Do not allow any site to show pop-ups.</li>
<li><em>Location:</em> Select “Do not allow any site to track my physical location.”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Configure passwords and forms settings:</strong> Disable Autofill and deselect “Offer to save passwords I enter on the web” under the “Passwords and forms” section. Doing so will prevent Chrome from saving your logins, passwords, and other sensitive information that you enter into forms.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this fight for online protection, keeping your main tool – the BROWSER – secure is a vital step. That is why our operating system defense should contain multiple layers of protection, from security products to manually customizing our browsers, since our web browser is actually the central tool we use to access our social media accounts, our e-mail addresses and our online banking websites.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">But,  there is an ongoing fight and challenge for online security and we have to be open and accept alternative means to protect our private data. Therefore, we want to know your opinion.</span></p>

        <hr />        <h1> Safe Browsing on the internet </h1>
        <p> Published Date : September 7, 2016<br />Author : tayo<br /><h4 style="text-align: justify;"><img class="aligncenter " src="http://www.vpnfaqs.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Anonymity-software.jpg" alt="" width="535" height="401" /></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;">While you are innocently surfing the Web, you may not realize that you could be picking up spyware, downloading malware, or even visiting fraudulent sites. Of course, you do not have to be afraid of every click you make, but there are some simple precautions you should take to stay safe while you&#8217;re browsing.</h4>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Protecting your computer against malicious sites</strong></em></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every browser has security features that protect you against visiting malicious sites that contain </span><b>malware</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or </span><b>phishing scams</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. When you visit a malicious site, your browser will display a </span><b>red warning message</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>                                                                       <img class="aligncenter" src="https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/uws.png?w=738" width="519" height="381" /></b></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Keeping your browser updated</strong></em></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">New malware and phishing threats are constantly being introduced, so it is important to keep your browser updated. </span><b>How do you do this?</b></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Make sure you have the latest version of your browser.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Make sure you have installed all recent updates.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></li>
</ol>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Domain checking</strong></em></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Malicious sites often use </span><b>deceptive domains</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to trick users into believing they are on a legitimate site. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example CBN site should be </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">www.cbn.com.ng</span><strong> and not </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">www.cbnn.com.ng</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with an extra </span><b>n.</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-478 size-full" src="http://178.62.60.23/wordpress/security-guide/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/who.is_.png" alt="who.is" width="528" height="199" srcset="http://178.62.60.23/wordpress/security-guide/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/who.is_.png 528w, http://178.62.60.23/wordpress/security-guide/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/who.is_-250x94.png 250w, http://178.62.60.23/wordpress/security-guide/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/who.is_-120x45.png 120w" sizes="(max-width: 528px) 100vw, 528px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Internet Explorer</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has a feature called </span><b>Domain Highlighting</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for checking domains. </span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Verifying secure sites<br />
</strong></em></h4>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Downloading precautions</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the easiest ways </span><b>malware, spyware</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and</span><b> adware</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can access your computer is through </span><b>downloads</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The following tips will help you download content safely.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Download only from trusted sites</strong></em></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You should only download from well-established sites you trust. </span><a href="http://download.cnet.com/"><b>CNET</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is one reputable site where you can download files that have been checked for malware, spyware, or adware. </span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Save downloads vs. running them</strong></em></h4>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/ciprahkapa/SH9sOx-RXtI/AAAAAAAABmg/Oyxy4UkJRYE/filedownloadPrompt%5B5%5D.png?imgmax=800" alt="" width="451" height="328" /></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Be cautious of freeware</strong></em></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="http://oi44.tinypic.com/2m31yq0.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="243" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Common types of </span><b>freeware</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (free software) include desktop backgrounds, free images, emoticons, computer games, etc.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Avoid illegal downloads</strong></em></h4>
<p><img class="aligncenter " src="http://www.newnownext.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Copyright.jpg" alt="" width="517" height="264" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you illegally download </span><b>copyrighted material</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> like music, books, software, games, and videos, you are violating federal laws, which can lead to fines and even jail time. </span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Be cautious of P2P file sharing</strong></em></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Peer-to-peer (P2P)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> file-sharing programs like BitTorrent and LimeWire have been known to contain malware, adware, and illegal downloads; therefore, it is best to practice caution when downloading and sharing from P2P sites. </span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Understanding how your browsing activity is tracked</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Did you know that your actions and what you click on may be tracked when you browse the Internet?<span style="font-weight: 400;"> Here are a few examples of how that can be done:</span></p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Websites like Amazon, eBay, and Netflix </span><b>collect data about your preferences</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> so they can make suggestions to you for products or movies they think you might like.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google tracks and analyzes activity </span><b>to provide statistical data to companies</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. These companies may use this data for marketing or advertising purposes, or to analyze the effectiveness of a website.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some governments may collect data about your online activity in case it is needed for </span><b>criminal investigations</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or </span><b>national security purposes</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is important to have an awareness of this tracking to practice safe browsing habits based on your desired level of privacy.</span></p>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;"></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Pop-up blockers</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Pop-ups</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are small browser windows that automatically pop up when you visit certain sites. They may sometimes be part of the legitimate functioning of a site, or they may contain </span><b>advertisements</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that can be annoying or objectionable. However, some pop-ups may contain </span><b>malware</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">; therefore, it&#8217;s a good idea to make sure your browser&#8217;s </span><b>pop-up blocker</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is turned on.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;">Turn on Pop-up blocker in Chrome</h4>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><img class="aligncenter " src="http://thewindowsclub.thewindowsclubco.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Block-Pop-Ups-in-Chrome.jpg" alt="" width="453" height="313" /></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;">Turn on Pop-up blocker in Internet Explorer</h4>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><img class="aligncenter " src="http://thewindowsclub.thewindowsclubco.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/block-pop-ups-in-internet-explorer.jpg" alt="" width="503" height="326" /></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Important:</span></strong> If you encounter a pop-up that seems suspicious, do not click</span><b> OK</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><b> Cancel</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or</span><b> Agree</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to try and close the window because this may access malware. Close the window by clicking the </span><b>X</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the upper-right corner or by pressing </span><b>ALT+F4</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">on your keyboard (if you use Windows).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>How to clear your cache</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Web browsers store pages, images, and downloaded content to the </span><b>cache</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> when you visit websites. The browser can speed up access to sites by loading pages from the cache rather than re-downloading content when you return to a site. However, with a high-speed Internet connection you may not notice the difference. In addition, the cache can take up space over time, causing your browser to slow down. Therefore, it&#8217;s a good idea to </span><b>clear the cache on a regular basis</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to help free up space on your computer.</span></p>

        <hr />        <h1> 10 Tips to Avoid Spam </h1>
        <p> Published Date : September 7, 2016<br />Author : tayo<br /><p style="text-align: justify;"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-458 " src="http://178.62.60.23/wordpress/security-guide/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/swpam.png" alt="swpam" width="601" height="467" srcset="http://178.62.60.23/wordpress/security-guide/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/swpam.png 668w, http://178.62.60.23/wordpress/security-guide/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/swpam-250x194.png 250w, http://178.62.60.23/wordpress/security-guide/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/swpam-120x93.png 120w" sizes="(max-width: 601px) 100vw, 601px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Below are 10 tips on how one can protect his email address to minimise the risk of getting spammed. Conveying these tips to all the users in your organization could help reduce the volume of spam received.</p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spammers in most cases need to know your email address before they can spam you so</span><b> keep your email address to yourself</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as much as possible and use it only for work purposes.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When posting on a forum </span><b>do not include your email address as part of your signature</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If need arises to post your e-mail address, format it so that it cannot be easily harvested such as &#8220;name –at- gmail – dot- com,&#8221; Or if you need to include your e-mail address in your signature, include a small graphic image containing your e-mail address.<br />
</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guest books are a prime source for the harvesting of email addresses that spammers use. Some guest books automatically hyperlink your email to your username; avoid posting in such forums and </span><b>never include your email address in the post</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> itself. Do not use your work email for this kind of personal use. If you do not have an alternative email address consider using free services such as Google mail, Yahoo! mail or Hotmail.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When signing up for forums, offers and other public services </span><b>never use your work email address</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">; if it doesn’t break the terms of use, consider using disposable email addresses. If terms prohibit the use of disposable email, use free email services that include spam filtering.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Never click on links in a spam email</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">; in some cases clicking will result in you confirming to the spammer that the email address is valid and the user is likely to click on links thus making you a prime target for more spam and phishing attacks.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Always </span><b>review the privacy terms on sites before registering</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. You need to know that whoever you’re signing up with will not give away your email address to third parties who might actually end up selling your email address for money.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you use IRC and chatrooms </span><b>ensure that you’re not displaying your email address publicly</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">(some IRC clients do this by default).</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have a personal website, </span><b>do not publish your work or personal email</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on it. Spammers use scanners that harvest such emails as well. Use free email services for this purpose.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Do not use the unsubscribe links in spam emails</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, in some case that will actually confirm the email address is valid to the spammer.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Do not open attachments in spam</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, you could get infected with Trojans that will send your email contacts to a spammer as well as entrap you in a spammer distribution chain i.e. your computer might be the one that the spammer uses to send spam emails.</span></li>

        <hr />        <h1> Most common attack vectors for breaking into websites and computer systems </h1>
        <p> Published Date : September 7, 2016<br />Author : tayo<br /><p style="text-align: justify;"><img class="aligncenter " src="http://zdnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/10/04/5883346b-4bd3-11e4-b6a0-d4ae52e95e57/resize/770xauto/ad9b1eefd9c8d4356163926e1e73a92a/credit-cnet-v3.jpg" alt="" width="722" height="407" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It seems that there are more and more news reports every day about how hackers have broken into the networks or website of a company or government department, and it happens everywhere around the world. How do attackers do it? They do it by following one or more of the following steps, and the ones they use depend on the nature of the attack.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Reconnaissance</strong><br />
The hacker tries to find out basic but important information about the system she&#8217;s targeting. For instance, they need to know the operating system, if there&#8217;s a firewall, what connection ports are open, what content management system (CMS) is used, and the identity of the main users. A good hacker will know how to harvest this information from open sources such as social media networks and search engines.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Known Vulnerabilities</strong><br />
A number of online sources publish information about different systems&#8217; security weaknesses and as a way of establishing bona fides, will also frequently publish the code that was used to attack the system. Hackers will use this information in planning and executing their attack.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">These attacks normally work when there are security lapses like improper configurations of servers and applications, the lack of firewalls on a network, or missing security patches.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>SQL Injection</strong><br />
This type of attack works by manipulating the database queries that the web application sends. An application can be vulnerable if it does not sanitize user input properly or uses untrusted parameter values in database queries without validation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://hackertarget.com/google-login.png" width="390" height="319" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Some of the ways of protecting against SQL injection are:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Using parameterized SQL</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Sanitizing/validating all untrusted parameters before using them in database operations</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Using tested and code reviewed libraries for database operations</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Using least privilege for database access (never let application use administrator user for database access)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Phishing</strong><br />
This type of attack is very old and still effective. The attacker normally sends out a lot of spam email to many people, and the messages contain links to fraudulent websites that have been made to look like, a bank&#8217;s website, for example. The message will ask the reader to enter some type of sensitive credential, which the fake website will capture and enable the attacker to impersonate the recipient or steal other valuable information – or in the case of payment card details, money.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="http://178.62.60.23/wordpress/security-guide/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/gone-phishing-again-700x266.png" alt="" width="700" height="266" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To best protect yourself, don&#8217;t ever click on a link in an email message from an unknown person, or in a suspicious-looking message. If you want to verify any requests for credentials such as your password, always type in the link directly into your browser and verify the information on the website that loads.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Spear Phishing</strong><br />
This is a type of phishing attack, but directed at a particular person or organisation. The email message will contain information that will convince the recipient that they know the person in question, as a way of trying to establish trust.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.imperial.ac.uk/ImageCropToolT4/imageTool/uploaded-images/Avoid-scams-600-X-600--tojpeg_1430913544649_x2.jpg" width="334" height="331" /></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Malware Attacks</strong><br />
Malware is a malicious software installed on your computer, mostly without your knowledge. This happens when an attacker sends out phishing emails with attachments containing the malicious code, or if you click on a file containing malware from a website.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Note:</span> Avoid clicking on Illegitimate links to win stuff, download free antivirus, Instant prize draw, etc&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Malware can control the user&#8217;s computer, capture key strokes, or look for documents on the computer.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Weak Authentication</strong><br />
Poor security such as weak passwords, insecure password reset methods, or allowing an indefinite number of invalid login attempts. A strong password is one that is difficult to guess or figure out.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Conclusion</strong><br />
The above mentioned methods are just a few common ways in which hackers can break into websites or computers. Everyone must bear responsibility for their individual and their organisation’s security, and know the latest methods of attack.</p>

        <hr />        <h1> Dangers Of Wireless Connection and How To Secure Yourself Using Public Wireless Connection </h1>
        <p> Published Date : September 7, 2016<br />Author : tayo<br /><p style="text-align: justify;"><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="http://www.tripwire.com/state-of-security/wp-content/uploads/security-14.png" alt="" width="620" height="334" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The reasons why people moved to Wireless connection is to overcome  the physical limitations of internet access. But from an attackers view, wireless connections are easy to target and intercept.</p>
<h3><strong>What Are Dangers Of Using Open/Public Wireless</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">People are always eager to use free wireless  without considering the dangers that comes with it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--35Ce7sMg--/c_fit,fl_progressive,q_80,w_636/195xlp534f141jpg.jpg" alt="" width="636" height="315" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Man in the Middle Attack</span> (MITM) can be described as a way in which an attacker intercepts connection between two systems i.e The Access Point and The Victims.  Here&#8217;s how it Works: An Attacker sets up a Fake Access point (free wi-fi) in a Public place and you quickly connect to it.The attacker has his own motive for creating this; to spoof your entire browsing history, including your usernames and passwords.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter " src="https://pentestmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/1.png" alt="" width="562" height="329" /></p>
<p>Another method is when you connect to a public wireless from a restaurant, airport, or an open space. and you’re Browsing through Facebook or Gmail. Since these sites are both encrypted with HTTPS and you’re pretty sure it is secured, And you think no one can intercept your connection since you’re browsing on  a secure site. The hacker intercepts this network through an attack called <a href="http://sectools.org/tool/sslstrip/">SSL Stripping</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">DNS Cache Poisoning is another method similar to SSL Stripping, Let’s say you want to browse Facebook?, Your Computer send request to the Wireless router to access Facebook and the Router send back the response back to your computer with Facebook. But with DNS Cache Poisoning, The<strong> Attacker</strong> is the one between the connection i.e the Wireless Connection and Your Computer.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When you Browse Facebook, instead of your Computer to communicate with the free wireless Connection directly it will pass through the <strong>Attackers</strong> Computer, Then to the <strong>Access Point</strong>, get response from the Wireless Connection back to the Attacker Computer, Then Back to you. With this he can do <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">modifications</span></strong> right from his computer so that whenever you browse Facebook or Gmail it may appear to you as Facebook but if you look closely, it&#8217;s just a <a href="https://safety.yahoo.com/Security/PHISHING-SITE.html">Phishing site.</a></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>How To Secure Yourself From Public/Open Wireless</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you want to use  a Public Connection always check that your website is accurate. That’s what most people don’t do, Browse On HTTPS site as we have mentioned earlier. Don’t do transactions with your Bank online as that’s the main reason for an attacker to intercept your connection. If you want to do that get yourself a private connection and do that.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Important:</span> Don’t forget to turn off your wireless connection when its not in use</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Secure Yourself with the Use of a VPN</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To protect against this type of attack you should use a VPN to make your online activities safe, secured and encrypted. There are many VPNs available on the internet, we have VyprVPN, Hide My Ass, OpenVPN and VPNGate. For this session, we would talk about VPN Gate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">VPN Gate is a free, non-commercial ‘Academic Experiment Project’ developed by the University of Tsukuba. The VPN Gate network consists of VPN relay servers located all over the world.</span></p>
<p><b>How to setup VPN GATE</b></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Visit www.vpngate.net/en/download.aspx </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Download and install the VPN GATE client.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Open the VPNGATE client</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CHoose the server you want to connect to.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once connected your connection becomes secured and you can browse the internet safely</span></li>

        <hr />        <h1> Creating Secure Passwords </h1>
        <p> Published Date : September 7, 2016<br />Author : tayo<br /><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">                               <img class="aligncenter " src="http://cdn1.tnwcdn.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2014/09/0903_key.jpg" alt="" width="635" height="423" />  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Passwords &#8212; especially those not supported by </span><a href="http://www.cnet.com/news/two-factor-authentication-what-you-need-to-know-faq/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">two-step verification</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8212; are your last lines of defense against prying eyes. This guide will help you understand how those passwords are exposed, and what you can do to keep them locked down.</span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><b>How are passwords exposed?</b></h3>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Someone&#8217;s out to get you. </b></li>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><b>You become the victim of a brute-force attack.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>There&#8217;s a data breach. </b></li>
</ol>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><b>What makes a good password?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ideally, each of your passwords would be at least 16 characters, and contain a combination of numbers, symbols, uppercase letters, lowercase letters, and spaces. The password would be free of repetition, dictionary words, usernames, pronouns, IDs, and any other predefined number or letter sequences</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://cyberwarzone.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/strong-password.png" alt="" width="485" height="195" /></span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><b>Creating secure passwords</b></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Create a phrase like &#8220;I hope Nigeria will win the FIFA World Cup  in 2016!&#8221; Then, take the initials of each word and all numbers and symbols to create your password. So, that phrase would result in this: <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>IhNwwtFWCi2016!</strong></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Also, make sure to use a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols in your password.For example, a password with numbers, symbols and mixed-case letters like <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Alph4b3t@</strong></span> (&#8220;Alphabeta&#8221; scrambled with numbers and symbols) is harder to guess.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many password managers like <strong>LastPass</strong> or <strong>Dashlane</strong> also have built in password generator tools.</span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><b><img class="alignright" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-c2bQ2XArhW4/VfRWZUVYJRI/AAAAAAAADIg/-9-ey1YudFo/s1600/How%2Bto%2BGenerate%2BGoogle%2BApplication%2BSpecific%2BPassword%2Bfor%2B2-Step%2BVerification.png" alt="" width="496" height="238" /></b><b>Enable two-step-verification</b></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Any time a service like Facebook or Gmail offers &#8220;two-step verification,&#8221; use it. When enabled, signing in will require you to also enter in a code that&#8217;s sent as a text message to your phone. Meaning, a hacker who isn&#8217;t in possession of your phone won&#8217;t be able to sign in, even if they know your password.</span></h3>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here&#8217;s a detailed <a href="https://twofactorauth.org/">list </a></span><a href="https://twofactorauth.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">how to set up two-step verification</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for many popular websites.</span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><b>Keeping track of secure passwords</b></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The logic is simple: if you recycle the same password (or a variation of it), and a hacker cracks one account, he or she will be able to access the rest of your accounts.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can&#8217;t be expected to memorize dozens of complicated, 16-character-long passwords but you can use a password manager to help you store them safely and encrypted.</span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><b><img class="aligncenter" src="https://screenshots.en.sftcdn.net/en/scrn/73000/73590/lastpass-21.jpg" alt="" width="487" height="366" /></b></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><b>Using a password manager</b></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Password managers store all of your passwords for you and fill out your log-in forms so that you don&#8217;t have to do any memorising. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many options available, but a few crowd favourite are </span><a href="http://lastpass.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">LastPass</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="http://dashlane.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dashlane</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="http://1password.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">1Password</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The tiny caveat is that you&#8217;ll still have to memorize one thing: Your master password. This unlocks all your other passwords. Make your master password extra-secure by composing it of at least 12 characters to ensure that it&#8217;s not vulnerable to any brute-force attacks.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every browser (Internet Explorer, Firefox, Google Chrome, Opera etc) keeps a copy of the sites you visit, the pages you click and even your password in a place called cache. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next person to use the computer may be able to check this information if they know what to do. </span></p>
<p>Using public computers at cybercafes, public libraries and even computers of friends can be safe if you do the following:</p>
<h2><b>Always sign Out</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make sure you sign out of websites by clicking </span><b>&#8220;log out&#8221;</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or </span><b>“sign out”</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on the site. Do not just close the browser and think you are safe. The next person may be able to open the browser and find you are still logged in.</span></p>

<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><b>Erase Your Tracks</b></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Web browsers such as Internet Explorer keep a record of your passwords and every page you visit, even after you’ve closed them and logged out.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you finish your use of a public computer, you should delete all the temporary files and your Internet history</span></p>

<h2 style="text-align: justify;"> <b>Create a Temporary Email Account</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most email accounts can forward to another one. If you are going away for a few days, create a temporary email account using mailinator.com and forward your emails there. </span></p>
<h2></h2>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"></h2>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><b>Watch Out for Snoops</b></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you use a public computer, be on the lookout for people who look over your shoulder or watch as you enter sensitive passwords to collect your information.<img class="size-medium aligncenter" src="http://cordopolis.es/estas-seguro-de-que-estas-seguro/files/2014/07/protect-shoulder-surfing.png" alt="" width="409" height="211" /></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A cell phone camera or someone with a good memory could capture your information easily. Don&#8217;t forget people can watch your hands and see what keys you press.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><b>Do not Enter Sensitive Information into a Public Computer</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These measures provide some protection against casual hackers who use a public computer after you have. If you can, use a USB drive to store your information.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you get home, change the passwords of any accounts you logged into while on the road. This will mitigate anyone tampering with your account.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But keep in mind that an industrious thief might have installed sophisticated software on the public computer that records every keystroke and then e-mails that information back to the thief.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you really want to be safe, avoid entering any sensitive information into any public computer.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><b>Do not Forget to Take your USB drive</b></h2>
<p>It happens. You get in a hurry and leave your USB drive (or floppy) on the public computer. You are forewarned.</p>

        <hr />        <h1> An Overview of Digital Security; The need and Dangers </h1>
        <p> Published Date : September 7, 2016<br />Author : tayo<br /><p style="text-align: justify;">Nasir is a journalist who uses social media platforms to meet new people. On Facebook he has about 2k friends, on twitter, he has 5k followers and a generous amount of instagram followers. He puts up his email contact and telephone numbers on all. Nasir receives an email from one of his twitter followers about a new case he might be interested in with a link attached to view more details. Unknown to him, it was a scam in form of Phishing, where they would have access to all his login information and bank details which he had stored on his email draft folder. This was how Nasir was ripped off of about 500,000 naira. This example stresses the need to secure yourself online.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Definition of Digital Security</strong><br />
Digital security is the protection of one’s digital personality, as it represents the physical identity on the network you are operating on or the internet service in use. Digital Security includes the tools which one uses to secure his/her identity, asset and technology in the online and mobile world. Simply put, let’s think of digital personality as the human body. Now, what are the methods (tools) we use to protect our bodies? Well, we eat and live healthy and put ourselves out of harm’s way.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Why do we need Digital Security?</strong><br />
Everyday, there are quite a number of cyber-attacks and anybody could be a victim of a cyber-theft, hack or crime. Leading global brands have been hacked with false information put up on them and small businesses and innovative start-ups in all industries are frequently targeted because most of them do not have proper digital security systems in place.  It is very common to see a popular activist tweet “the previous tweets from my account were not from me. I was hacked”. Also, from the above story of Nasir, we can see why it is important to protect ourselves digitally. Nobody is ready to part with things they worked hard to achieve and acquire.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>What digital security tools are available to us?</strong><br />
The most important Digital Security tool available to everyone is actually free and we all have access to that tool. This is none other than being concerns and aware of the fact that the information we share over digital spaces could be used against us. Hence we should be careful as to what we share digitally and he extra cautions when receiving information which we suspect might be fraudulent.<br />
There are quite a number of digital security tools available to users and these are identified below:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>&#8211; Tools for anonymous navigation online</strong><br />
If you intend to navigate the internet without giving off your location, you could install a software called <a href="https://www.torproject.org/">Tor</a> on your computer, which allows you hide your location and keeps whatever you are doing on the internet private. Very easy to install, Tor is also free. Another software which is also free is <a href="https://www.anonymox.net/en">AnonymoX</a> and is available to Firefox and Google Chrome web browsers as addons.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>&#8211; Tools for telephone encryption</strong><br />
SilentPhone for phone calls. Free, and works on the <span style="color: #0000ff;"><a style="color: #0000ff;" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.silentcircle.silentphone&amp;hl=en">Android OS</a></span> and <span style="color: #0000ff;"><a style="color: #0000ff;" href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/silent-phone/id554269204?mt=8">iOS devices</a>.</span><br />
<a href="https://whispersystems.org/">Signal</a> created by a firm called the “Guardian Project”. It is available on almost all device and operating system. Signal encrypts your voice and video conversations and is a better alternative to using Skype.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>&#8211; Tools to encrypt instant messaging</strong><br />
If you are someone who shares important information via instant messaging, you should use <a href="https://www.cyph.com/">Cyph</a> which encrypts messages for both mac and windows users.</p>
<p><a href="https://chatsecure.org/">ChatSecure</a>  works perfectly on <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/chatsecure/id464200063">iOS</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=info.guardianproject.otr.app.im">Android</a> platforms</p>

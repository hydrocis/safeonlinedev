        <p> Published Date : October 27, 2016<br />Author : tayo<br /><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class="size-medium aligncenter" src="https://www.callcentrehelper.com/images/stories/2010/2015/11/agent-desktop-mistake-510.jpg" alt="" width="510" height="291" /></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">But what exactly are the most common mistakes that users make which expose them to cyber threats?</span></i></p>
<ol>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">  People tend to leave their passwords hanging on the computer with sticky notes, so it’s easier to remember but it’s pretty easy for a hacker to get a hold of it. Use a<strong><em> password management program</em></strong> that makes it easy to create a unique password per site they register with.</span></li>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t use weak passwords like ‘password’ because it takes less time to crack than passwords like this ‘Alph4b3t@’ and don’t use the same <em><strong>password twice</strong></em> because if a hacker gets through one of your account, he would come for others.</span></li>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Not opting into extra security offered</strong> – such as the two-factor authentication offered by Dropbox, Facebook, Google and more could give free access to your personal details and private information.</span></li>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>People don’t stop to think</strong> about the worst-case scenario of what might happen if their private information is hacked or even company info leaked online to a competitor.</span></li>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Privacy exposure</strong> is also a huge mistake every user makes. People often say “I have nothing to hide” and as a consequence they expose all their information, sometimes without knowing. It could be through the terms of agreement or terms of condition to an app.</span></li>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The mistake companies make when it comes to securing sensitive data is that <strong>they are clueless</strong> as to where their data resides and how to categorize it or make requirement for stronger security protocols.</span></li>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another mistake is the <strong>lack of a correct evaluation</strong> of the surface of attack. In the majority of cases, users totally ignore and overlook cyber threats, threat actors and their tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs)</span></li>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The biggest mistake is to <strong>choose the cheapest option</strong> without considering the supplier’s reputation. Take VPNs as an example. If you pay a respectable company to provide you with VPN services, then you stand a greater chance of being secure than if you trust in a provider that you know little about and somehow has the ability to provide free, reliable and secure services.</span></li>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>L</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>eaving the machine on</strong>, unattended. Its amazing the number of users who leave their machines on, without protection, and walk away. Who needs a password?</span></li>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Opening e-mail attachments</strong> from mere acquaintances or even strangers. Users tend to open all their e-mail attachments before thinking about who the sender is. </span></li>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Laptops have legs</strong>. Everyone knows how common it is for laptops to be stolen in public places, but it&#8217;s surprisingly common for a person to leave his laptop in his office, unsecured and unattended, and in full view of passersby. &#8220;These things walk,&#8221; he warns. Users should place their laptop securely out of sight, such as in a locked desk drawer.</span></li>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Failing to consider the staff</strong>. &#8220;Your greatest [security] threat is from in-house,&#8221; says Hill. Disgruntled employees and others can cause enormous problems if they&#8217;re not properly monitored. IT departments should do a good job monitoring incidents and have the forensics capabilities to be able to follow problems to their sources.</span></li>

        <hr />        <h1> Creating Secure Passwords </h1>
        <p> Published Date : September 8, 2016<br />Author : tayo<br /><p style="text-align: justify;"><img class="aligncenter " src="http://www.homecityfederal.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/password-1.jpg" alt="" width="635" height="423" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Passwords &#8212; especially those not supported by </span><a href="http://www.cnet.com/news/two-factor-authentication-what-you-need-to-know-faq/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">two-step verification</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8212; are your last lines of defense against prying eyes. This guide will help you understand how those passwords are exposed, and what you can do to keep them locked down.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>How are passwords exposed?</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are a few ways your account passwords can be compromised.</span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Someone&#8217;s out to get you. </b></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>You become the victim of a <span style="color: #333300;"><a style="color: #333300;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brute-force_attack">brute-force attack</a></span>.</b></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>There&#8217;s a data breach. </b></li>
</ol>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><b>What makes a good password?</b></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ideally, each of your passwords would be at least 16 characters, and contain a combination of numbers, symbols, uppercase letters, lowercase letters, and spaces. The password would be free of repetition, dictionary words, user-names, pronouns, IDs, and any other predefined number or letter sequences.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ideal passwords, however, are a huge inconvenience. How can we be expected to remember 12-character  passwords for each of our various Web accounts? That&#8217;s where many people turn to password managers like LastPass, Dashlane and 1Password.</span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><b>Creating secure passwords</b></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Create a phrase like &#8220;I hope Nigeria will win the FIFA World Cup  in 2016!&#8221; Then, take the initials of each word and all numbers and symbols to create your password. So, that phrase would result in this: <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>IhNwwtFWCi2016!</strong></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Also, make sure to use a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols in your password. Using numbers, symbols and mix of upper and lower case letters in your password makes it harder for someone to guess your password. For example, a password with numbers, symbols and mixed-case letters like <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Alph4b3t@</strong></span> (&#8220;Alphabeta&#8221; scrambled with numbers and symbols) is harder to guess because it has 30,000 times as many possible combinations than an eight-character password with only lower case letters.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many password managers like LastPass or Dashlane also have built in password generator tools.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: left;"><b><img class="size-medium alignleft" src="https://lh3.ggpht.com/jIcGqn4JW2B-M7J_H3S0pM6rt29o14mTpt7dH9aapGCXRzUcoqNabCvWLMv9hRw-qiLdb1MrjA=w265" alt="" width="265" height="162" />Enable two-step-verification</b></h4>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When enabled, signing in will require you to also enter in a code that&#8217;s sent as a text message to your phone. Meaning, a hacker who isn&#8217;t in possession of your phone won&#8217;t be able to sign in, even if they know your password.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You only have to do this once for &#8220;recognized&#8221; computers and devices.</span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"></h3>
<h4 style="text-align: left;"><b>Securing your passwords using a password manager </b></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: left;"><b><img class="alignright" src="http://techbakbak.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/review-lastpass.png" alt="" width="386" height="210" /></b></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Password managers store all of your passwords for you and fill out your log-in forms so that you don&#8217;t have to do any memorising. If you want super secure passwords for your online accounts (which is recommended), but you don&#8217;t want to memorise them all (also recommended), this is the way to go. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many options available, but a few crowd favourite are </span><a href="http://lastpass.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">LastPass</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="http://dashlane.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dashlane</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="http://1password.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">1Password</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The tiny caveat is that you&#8217;ll still have to memorize one thing: Your master password. This unlocks all your other passwords. Make your master password extra-secure by composing it of at least 12 characters to ensure that it&#8217;s not vulnerable to any brute-force attacks.</span></p>

        <p> Published Date : September 7, 2016<br />Author : tayo<br /><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-431 size-full" src="http://178.62.60.23/wordpress/security-guide/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/trojan-word-cloud-600x401.jpg" alt="trojan-word-cloud-600x401" width="600" height="401" srcset="http://178.62.60.23/wordpress/security-guide/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/trojan-word-cloud-600x401.jpg 600w, http://178.62.60.23/wordpress/security-guide/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/trojan-word-cloud-600x401-250x167.jpg 250w, http://178.62.60.23/wordpress/security-guide/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/trojan-word-cloud-600x401-120x80.jpg 120w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The amount and variety of malicious programs out there is enough to make your head spin. This article will break down the common types of malicious programs and provide a brief description of each.</span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>What is Malware?</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Malware is short for malicious software, meaning software that can be used to compromise computer functions, steal data, bypass access controls, or otherwise cause harm to the host computer. Malware is a broad term that refers to a variety of malicious programs. This post will define several of the most common types of malware;  bots, ransomeware, spyware, Trojan horses, viruses, and worms.</span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Bot</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bots are software programs created to automatically perform specific operations. While some bots are created for relatively harmless purposes, nowadays, bots are being used maliciously. Bots can be used in botnets (network of bots/computers controlled by third parties) for DDoS attacks, as spambots that render advertisements on websites, as web spiders that scrape server data, and for distributing malware disguised as popular search items on download sites. Websites can guard against bots with CAPTCHA tests that verify users as human.</span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Ransomware</strong></h3>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-433 aligncenter" src="http://178.62.60.23/wordpress/security-guide/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/locky-ransomware-FB-250x250.jpg" alt="locky-ransomware-FB" srcset="http://178.62.60.23/wordpress/security-guide/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/locky-ransomware-FB-250x250.jpg 250w, http://178.62.60.23/wordpress/security-guide/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/locky-ransomware-FB-150x150.jpg 150w, http://178.62.60.23/wordpress/security-guide/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/locky-ransomware-FB-768x768.jpg 768w, http://178.62.60.23/wordpress/security-guide/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/locky-ransomware-FB-700x700.jpg 700w, http://178.62.60.23/wordpress/security-guide/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/locky-ransomware-FB-120x120.jpg 120w, http://178.62.60.23/wordpress/security-guide/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/locky-ransomware-FB.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ransomware is a form of malware that essentially holds a computer system captive while demanding a ransom. The malware restricts user access to the computer either by encrypting files on the hard drive or locking down the system and displaying messages that are intended to force the user to pay the malware creator to remove the restrictions and regain access to their computer.<br />
</span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Spyware</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spyware is a type of malware that functions by spying on user activity without their knowledge. These spying capabilities can include activity monitoring, </span><a href="https://www.veracode.com/security/keylogger"><span style="font-weight: 400;">collecting keystrokes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, data harvesting (account information, logins, financial data), and more. Spyware often has additional capabilities as well, ranging from modifying security settings of software or browsers to interfering with network connections. Spyware spreads by exploiting software vulnerabilities, bundling itself with legitimate software, or in Trojans.</span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Trojan Horse</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Trojan horse, commonly known as a “Trojan,” is a type of malware that disguises itself as a normal file or program to trick users into downloading and installing malware. A Trojan can give a malicious party remote access to an infected computer. Once an attacker has access to an infected computer, it is possible for the attacker to steal data (logins, financial data, even electronic money), install more malware, modify files, monitor user activity (screen watching, keylogging, etc), use the computer in botnets, and anonymize internet activity by the attacker.</span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Virus</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A virus is a form of malware that is capable of copying itself and spreading to other computers. Viruses often spread to other computers by attaching themselves to various programs and executing code when a user launches one of those infected programs.  Viruses can be used to steal information, harm host computers and networks, create botnets, steal money, render advertisements, and more.</span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Worm</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Computer worms are  the most common types of malware. They spread over computer networks by exploiting operating system vulnerabilities</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Computer worms can also contain “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payload_%28computing%29">payloads</a>” that damage host computers.<br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> A major difference between</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> computer worms and viruses are that worms have the ability to self-replicate and spread independently while viruses rely on human activity to spread (running a program, opening a file, etc). Worms often spread by sending mass emails with infected attachments to users’ contacts.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Knowledge of these types of malware should get you security conscious all the time you spend online, and help you to take extra caution in downloading  and using certain applications.</p>

        <hr />        <h1> How to detect a malicious e-mail </h1>
        <p> Published Date : July 27, 2016<br />Author : tayo<br /><p><img class="aligncenter " src="https://www.cgsinc.com/sites/default/files/styles/blog_details/public/media/images/blog/bug.jpg?itok=tkglNnFa" alt="" width="392" height="434" /></p>
<p>Below we&#8217;ve shared with you some methods to identify phishing, or spoofing, e-mail messages. Please share it widely.</p>
<p><b>Tip 1: Be wary of the display name</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cybercriminals often spoof the display name of an email message – it&#8217;s one of their go-to tactics. The consultancy </span><a href="http://returnpath.com/research/email-threat-intelligence-report-insights-into-brand-spoofing-tactics/?sfdc=701000000006b8I"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Return Path analyzed more than 760,000 email threats</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> targeting 40 large, global companies and found that nearly half the email threats spoofed the brand in the display name. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, if a fraudster wanted to spoof a bank called, for instance, “My Bank,” the message may look something like this:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since My Bank doesn’t own the domain “secure.com,” the Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting &amp; Conformance protocol (DMARC) will not block this email on My Bank’s behalf, even if My Bank has set their DMARC policy for mybank.com to reject fake messages. When this fraudulent message is delivered, it will appear legitimate because most email inboxes don&#8217;t show the domain name – only the user name, so it&#8217;s important not to trust the display name. What you should do is check the email address in the header and if it doesn&#8217;t seem right to you, don’t open the message.</span></p>
<p><b>Tip 2: Look at, but don’t click on links in the body of the message</b></p>
<p>If you&#8217;re unsure about an email, hover your mouse cursor over any links you see in the body of the message (but please don&#8217;t click it!). Look at the lower left corner of your browser or email client, you should see the exact address of the link you&#8217;re hovering over. If the link you see looks suspicious, then the probability that it is malicious is very high.</p>
<p><b>Tip 3: Are there obvious spelling mistakes?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Major brands take their image seriously, and this includes the language used in their communications. They wouldn&#8217;t send something out that has bad grammar, sentence structure or typos. If your message has any of these, it&#8217;s likely fraudulent. </span></p>
<p><b>Tip 4: Scrutinize the greeting </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Real, legitimate businesses will address you with your first name and surname, not with a generic “Dear Client.” </span></p>
<p><b>Tip 5: Don’t release sensitive personal or other data</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most companies will not ask you for sensitive credentials over e-mail, so don&#8217;t give them if asked.</span></p>
<p><b>Tip 6: Beware of urgent or threatening language in the subject line</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A common phishing tactic to instill a sense of urgency or fear. So be careful when you see subject lines saying “Your account has been suspended” or your account had an “unauthorized login attempt,” or something along those lines.</span></p>
<p><b>Tip 7: Look at the signature</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lack of details about the signer or how you can contact a company strongly suggests a phish. Legitimate businesses always provide contact details.</span></p>
<p><b>Tip 8: Do not ever open attachments</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Malicious attachments often contain viruses and malware that can damage your computer, steal data or spy on you without your knowledge, and including them is a common phishing tactic. </span></p>
<p><b>Tip 9: Don’t trust the email header </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fraudsters also spoof brands in the email address header. Return Path found that nearly 30% of more than 760,000 email threats spoofed brands somewhere in the header from email address, and over two thirds of them spoofed the brand in the email domain alone.</span></p>
<p><b>Tip 10: Don’t believe everything you see</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Phishers are very talented at fooling people. So, even if an email message has convincing logos, language, and a valid email address, it&#8217;s not necessarily legitimate. Be skeptical when it comes to your email messages—if it looks even remotely suspicious, don’t open it.</span></p>

        <hr />        <h1> How to Manage Your Social Media Privacy Settings </h1>
        <p> Published Date : September 8, 2016<br />Author : tayo<br /><p style="text-align: justify;"><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="http://farend.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/social-media.jpg" alt="" width="442" height="325" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We post a lot of information about ourselves across many social media websites, like Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram, among others. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In doing so, a lot of people who use social media share far too many personal details. But they have to be careful because cybercriminals use this sensitive information to create fraudulent identities, and compromise careers. But, overall, remember, the fewer details you share online, the safer your information will be.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Below are steps to help protect your sensitive information on Facebook and Twitter, two of the most popular social media sites. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">   </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Facebook</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Facebook has different privacy settings for many aspects of a user&#8217;s social profile, which must be adjusted individually. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">The categories of audience are:</span></em></p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li><b>Public</b></li>
</ul>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Only me</b></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/--m73qinpICU/Uv4h1yCFVoI/AAAAAAAAHIk/7gTAsBm4Lyg/s1600/custom-facebook-gender-privacy.jpg" alt="" width="660" height="384" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you want to keep your information private, don&#8217;t use any of the “Public” settings.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, before posting a status, see who your potential audience will be. You can adjust this setting in two places.</span></p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first is under &#8220;Privacy Settings and Tools.&#8221; Click the downward-pointing arrow in the top right corner. Choose &#8220;Settings,&#8221; then find &#8220;Privacy&#8221; on the left. Choose a privacy level for your posts.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Click in the &#8220;Update Status&#8221; field (&#8220;What&#8217;s on your mind?&#8221;). Then use the drop-down menu to the left of the &#8220;post&#8221; button. Choose a privacy level for your posts.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remember, these settings apply to all posts unless you change them again.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><img class="aligncenter " src="https://wengcaro.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/targeting-and-privacy-setting.png" alt="" width="873" height="401" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the most privacy, select &#8220;Friends&#8221; so only your friends see your posts.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Manage your privacy settings</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the &#8220;Privacy Settings and Tools,&#8221; you can control more settings for maximum security:</span></p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Who can see my stuff?&#8221; Select &#8220;Friends.&#8221; Also review your Activity Log and  audience for past posts, to make sure they&#8217;re secure.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Who can contact me?&#8221; Choose &#8220;Friends&#8221; or &#8220;Friends of Friends&#8221; for people who can contact you.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Who can look me up?&#8221; Choose &#8220;Friends.&#8221;</span></li>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Manage your apps</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consider examining which third-party applications have access to your Facebook profile. To view which apps you have previously approved, access the &#8220;Privacy Settings and Tools&#8221; panel you found above, and select &#8220;Apps&#8221; from the left-side bar navigation.</span></p>

Posts that friends tag you in appear in the News Feed, the search, and on your timeline. You can counter this by altering your &#8220;Timeline and Tagging&#8221; options under &#8220;Privacy Settings and Tools.&#8221;</span></p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enable the feature that allows you to review posts before they are published to your Timeline.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is important to note that these updates from friends still appear in News Feed and search.</span></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Twitter</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
Twitter is the second largest social networking site in the U.S. and allows users to share 140-character updates, called &#8220;tweets,&#8221; with their friends and followers. Tweets can also include links and photos. Twitter&#8217;s default settings set your account to public, meaning your tweets and information can be viewed by anyone, even by non-Twitter users. There are some simple settings that can allow you to make your Twitter account private.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a private account:</span></em></p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Only Twitter users you approve can subscribe and see your tweets.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Any tweets previously made public will be hidden, and can only approved followers can see or search them.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your tweets will also no longer appear in Google searches or be &#8220;re-tweetable,&#8221; (which means they can be sent on to another user).</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Only approved followers will see any @replies you send.</span></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">To make your Twitter account private, click the wheel icon in the top right of your Twitter homepage and select &#8220;Settings&#8221; from the drop-down menu, then select &#8220;Security and Privacy&#8221; from the side-bar menu.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under &#8220;Privacy,&#8221; check the box &#8220;Protect my tweets.&#8221;</span></p>

        <hr />        <h1> How to prevent Unwanted access to your facebook account </h1>
        <p> Published Date : September 8, 2016<br />Author : tayo<br /><p style="text-align: justify;"><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-FwWM8lIhNeY/U4aHYpmMDTI/AAAAAAAAAL8/Tio7EFE9aR4/s1600/Facebook-access-denied.jpg" alt="" width="574" height="286" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>1. Create a strong password</strong><br />
Chances are, you already have your Facebook password. But you should make sure it is unique, meaning that you don&#8217;t use it anywhere else.<br />
To change your password, go to Account Settings &gt; General &gt; Password. <a href="http://178.62.60.23/wordpress/security-guide/index.php/2016/09/08/creating-secure-passwords-2/">Learn more here</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>2. Confirm your mobile number</strong><br />
Doing this ensures that, even if you lose or forget your password, Facebook will be able to send you a new one via text message.<br />
To add your mobile number, go to Account Settings &gt; Mobile and click on Add a Phone.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>3. Activate secure browsing, now</strong><br />
Another way of making sure your Facebook browsing activity is safe is to turn on Secure browsing. This automatically prevents any external applications that are integrated with Facebook from doing any harm or taking your personal information without your knowledge or approval.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To secure your account, click the drop down menu from the top right corner of your Facebook account and go to Account Settings.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Select &#8216;Security&#8217; from the left menu.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At the Secure Browsing section, click on the Edit link at the right.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When the option panel appears, check the box &#8216;Browse Facebook on a secure connection,&#8217; then click the Save Changes button.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>4. Activate ‘Login Approvals’</strong><br />
Login approvals is an extended security feature offered by Facebook. It requires you to enter a security code each time you try to access your Facebook account from an unrecognised device. To activate Login Approvals, go to Account Settings &gt; Security, look for Login Approvals and click on the Edit button.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When the option to activate Login Approvals will appear, tick the check box to activate.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When a popup window will appear with descriptions of login approvals, click on the &#8216;Set Up Now&#8217; button to continue.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If your mobile number is already registered, Facebook will automatically send you a code via SMS. Enter this code in the given box and click Submit Code.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now you have completed the Login Approvals request, so you can click Next to continue.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Next, Facebook will offer you to setup a Code Generator from your mobile phone. This would help in case you are unable to receive SMS. Click Continue.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/270942386330392?helpref=faq_content">Code generator for Android phones</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>5. Disconnect previous active sessions</strong><br />
The good thing about Facebook is that it lets you know about your previous active sessions, where you log in from, and what devices you used to access your Facebook account. Now, to make sure your account is safe, from the Account Settings &gt; Security page, look for ‘Active Sessions‘ and click on Edit.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Click on the link ‘End Activity‘ to kill the sessions on all other devices.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>6. Activate Private Browsing</strong><br />
Another way to prevent another person from accessing your account is by activating ‘Private Browsing’ from your browsers. All browsers have this feature, which prevents them from logging your browsing history.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Safari<br />
If you are using the Safari Browser on Mac, activate Private Browsing from the menu with Safari &gt; Private Browsing.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Firefox<br />
For Firefox, go to Tools &gt; Start Private Browsing.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Chrome<br />
If you are using Chrome, you can browse privately in the Incognito window. To open this window, go to File &gt; New Incognito Window.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>7. Don’t ‘Keep Me Logged In’</strong><br />
The moment you want to login to your Facebook account, at the Log In page, there’s a small checkbox that says Keep me logged in. Make sure this box is unchecked. Then, log in as usual. With this on, you will be asked for your email and password every time you launch Facebook.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>8. Avoid clicking on links from spam email</strong><br />
Facebook is serious about protecting its users from spam and often enhances its features to make sure you do not become a victim. The types of attacks include requests for via Facebook messages, chat, phishing links that will redirect you to fake websites, or malicious links that could retrieve your personal information or even harm your computer. There are also chances you may receive emails that at first glance look like they&#8217;re from Facebook, are actually from a phishing website.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>There are many ways you can avoid being a victim:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Never click on suspicious links.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Never give out your username or password to anyone, especially not to websites with suspicious-looking links and layouts.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Log in only from www.facebook.com and not from any other link or website.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Update your browser to its latest version to ensure your browser’s security is up to date. This will enable it detect attacks and alert you when you are navigating to a suspected phishing site.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>9. Sign out after use</strong><br />
Lastly which is the most important of all, and definitely worth repeating, is, never forget to log out from your Facebook account.</p>

        <hr />        <h1> How to Protect your Mobile Device </h1>
        <p> Published Date : October 27, 2016<br />Author : tayo<br /><p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="http://2sx4j07zuxdi0t8e31bohpulq.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/mobile-security-apps-300x300.png" alt="" width="300" height="300" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With millions of people getting online through their mobile phones everyday, so has the security threats to target such mobile platforms and operating systems increased.</p>
<p>Due to these results, many users are worried about the security of their mobile devices and the data in it.</p>
<p>But not to worry, there are some measures you can take to protect your devices online.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong> Lock Your Device</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The first best way to protect your device and the information in it is to create a phone lock by either using a pin code, patterns or a fingerprint-sensitive lock. This way, if someone else gets hold of your phone, they’ll only be able to reset the phone without getting hold of your sensitive data.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong> Watch What You Download</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Most of the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.avast.android.mobilesecurity">antivirus</a> options available for the mobile devices aren’t generally as strong as the ones that have been developed for PC. So ensure that the apps you download on your phones are from recognized stores like the App store for Apple devices or the Google Play store for android. Any other site might just contain Viruses or Malware that may steal your information.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong> Get Regular Security Updates</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The technology that keeps your mobile information safe is evolving very quickly. In order to take advantage of this, you can set your phone to automatically update its security software. This way, you’ll stay protected from new security threats.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong> Use Wireless Networks Judiciously</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Getting a free wireless network to connect to can be such a fun thing especially if your data plan is running low. However, you need to be careful about which Wi-Fi networks you sign into.</p>
<p>To prevent this from happening, try to stick with known sources for your Internet connection, If you must use one, don’t give any private information like usernames, passwords, Bank details, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> be sure to turn off your wireless networks unless you absolutely need them at that moment. It’s better to be off Internet access for a while, than it is to connect to an unsecured and potentially dangerous WiFi signal.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li><strong> Use Remote Wipes</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>If you have sensitive information that you would like to remain private, it’s important to have a <a href="http://searchmobilecomputing.techtarget.com/definition/remote-wipe">remote wiping system</a> for your phone. In case the information on your phone is compromised or the phone is stolen, you’ll be able to erase the data and history from another phone or computer.</p>
<p>Before you set up your remote wipe, it can be helpful to have a copy of your information stored in another place, such as in the cloud or on your desktop computer.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li><strong> Security for Businesses</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Since more and more workers will access sensitive company information from their phones, businesses may need to consider how they can protect their sensitive and/or valuable information on these mobile platforms. For businesses security, a remote wiping system is crucial when your employees are working on the go.</p>
<p>Your digital devices is important, if you let criminals into your digital system you might as well let them walk all over your company property.</p>
<p>You may also want to place some restrictions about how and what your employees can do on their business-use mobile devices. For instance, if you provide employees with company phones for working remotely, there is a smaller chance that they will download an unsavory app onto the phone and compromise your data.</p>

        <hr />        <h1> How to Spot a Social Media Fake </h1>
        <p> Published Date : September 8, 2016<br />Author : tayo<br /><p style="text-align: justify;"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-481 size-full" src="http://178.62.60.23/wordpress/security-guide/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/fake-social-media-profiles.jpg" alt="fake-social-media-profiles" width="608" height="375" srcset="http://178.62.60.23/wordpress/security-guide/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/fake-social-media-profiles.jpg 608w, http://178.62.60.23/wordpress/security-guide/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/fake-social-media-profiles-250x154.jpg 250w, http://178.62.60.23/wordpress/security-guide/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/fake-social-media-profiles-120x74.jpg 120w" sizes="(max-width: 608px) 100vw, 608px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">More and more people, regardless of age and gender, are signing up for profiles on online social networks. Some have hundreds or thousands of followers spread across multiple profiles. But pollution of social media networks through creation of fake profiles is becoming increasingly common. Fake profiles often spam legitimate users, posting inappropriate or illegal content. Several signs can help you spot a social media fake who might be trying to scam you.</span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Step 1</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Read through the updates posted on the profile of the suspected faker. Accounts that only broadcast or push out updates and content instead of having conversations and engaging with other community members are often fake. If users do engage with you, be wary of requests to wire money or reveal sensitive information &#8212; a tactic often used by scammers. Such requests might come from users posing as a friend or family member. For example, if a friend contacts you via a social network asking for money, call him to confirm that the request came from him.</span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Step 2</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keep an eye out for accounts that repeatedly push out spam. Signs include sharing the same link repeatedly in a short period of time and providing misleading information about the destination of a link.</span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Step 3</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Look for a verification indicator on the social media accounts of <strong>high-profile users</strong>. Accounts without verification might belong to an imposter. Consult the social media network&#8217;s FAQs or user guidelines to familiarize yourself with the look and location of a legitimate verification indicator. For example, Twitter displays a light blue verification badge (check-mark icon) at the top left corner of a verified account, above the profile name, Twitter handle and bio. Badges that appear on a different part of the profile, such as a user&#8217;s avatar, are not legitimate.</span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Step 4</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Watch for profiles created to provide phony reviews on social ratings and reviews sites. Fake reviews often do not comment on the specifics of a company&#8217;s product or service. Instead, they tend to give overwhelmingly positive or negative feedback about only the brand.</span></p>

        <hr />        <h1> Phishing and Spoofing </h1>
        <p> Published Date : September 8, 2016<br />Author : tayo<br /><p style="text-align: justify;"><img class="aligncenter " src="https://media.licdn.com/mpr/mpr/p/3/005/0ae/389/37effbc.jpg" alt="" width="606" height="347" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The widespread use of Emails (electronic mail) and SMS (short message service) has given opportunity to cyber criminals to defraud unsuspecting users with various techniques of Email and SMS <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phishing">phishing</a> and spoofing.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Recent findings show that 30% of all <strong>email phishing attacks</strong> in Nigeria target bank account holders, 5% of recipients of these emails call their account officers to verify the emails while a whopping 25% believe the email actually originated from their bank and do not verify them. They end up being defrauded, losing all funds from their account.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Some of the various types of phishing message come in the following forms:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Emails received from the bank or other institution asking users to provide or update their personal details.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Emails received from well-known companies for winning lottery or jackpot asking users to provide personal details.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Emails received with an attachment asking users to unzip, install or download to increase system performance or win shopping points e.t.c. These attachments mostly contain malicious files which scans users’ system hard drive and try to extract saved passwords, IDs and other personal information without users suspecting.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Spoofing on the other hand is a form of theft technique where users get phone calls or text messages (SMS) from what appears to be legitimate sources. Example of sources used are impersonating the banks, telecommunication companies, fraudulent short codes or phone numbers and details of people users know, love and respect.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-WY0oxL_ZR4A/UCYAXI7nAbI/AAAAAAAAAeE/Kw49fz5GfwI/s1600/facebook-phishing-email-scam.jpg" alt="" width="632" height="332" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The content of SMS used in defrauding unsuspecting users vary from messages claiming a lottery win of huge amount of money, deactivated bank accounts, offer for jobs, help for a relative, spiritual guidance and in some extreme cases actual calls requesting for user ATM card and pin numbers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Guarding against Email and SMS phishing and spoofing</strong></p>
<ol>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Never click on hyperlinks within suspicious looking emails e.g containing spelling mistakes, grammatical errors or offers looking too good to be true.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Do not trust email attachments, even if they come from a trusted source. Unless you’re expecting an email with an attachment, call the sender and confirm they sent it. Their computer might have been compromised and could be sending emails without their knowledge, or their email address could have been spoofed.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Never download files from un-trusted websites.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Never reveal personal or financial information in response to an email or SMS request, no matter who appears to have sent it.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Terminate any SMS message that request cash to process lottery wins or job offers.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Ensure you have updated Anti-Virus Software on your devices.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Use legitimate operating systems and software. Keep them updated regularly.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Always look for &#8220;https&#8221; and a green padlock on websites that request personal information or shopping sites that request bank account and ATM card payments.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Report phishing and spoofing Emails and SMS.</li>

        <hr />        <h1> Protect your Google account with Two-Step Verification </h1>
        <p> Published Date : September 8, 2016<br />Author : tayo<br /><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two-step verification (2SV) is a login feature available on many online accounts today. It provides an additional step (but not an added factor) in the authentication process by prompting a user to enter a code sent to their computer or pre-verified device.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2SV therefore has the ability to protect a user&#8217;s account in the event that their corresponding password has been compromised.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the most important things a user can protect with 2SV is their Google account, which can be used for personal and business email, social networking on Google+, and other purposes. Provided below is a guide on how you can enable this feature on your Google account.</span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li><b></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Sign into your Google account.</span></li>
<li><b></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> At the top right of your browser screen, you will find a circular icon that either contains the first letter of your username or a picture of yourself. Click on that icon.</span></li>
<li><b></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> A profile card containing your username, your full Google email, and a number of buttons will load beneath the icon. Click on the blue button labeled &#8220;My Account.&#8221;</span></li>
<li><b></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> A new tab will load that brings you to the home page for &#8220;My Account.&#8221; Scroll down on that page and click on the &#8220;Sign-in &amp; security&#8221; setting.</span></li>
<li><b></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The Google Sign-in &amp; security page will load up. You can use this page to manage the security settings of your account, including setting up a recovery email and phone, changing your password, and conducting a security checkup of your account. You can also set up 2SV here.</span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scroll down the page. Under the &#8220;Signing in to Google&#8221; sub-heading, you will find a box entitled &#8220;Password &amp; sign-in method.&#8221; In that box, click on &#8220;2-Step Verification.&#8221; (NOTE: This feature should be labeled &#8220;Off&#8221; if you have not already enabled 2SV on your account.)</span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="6">
<li><b></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> On the right-hand sign of the &#8220;Signing in with 2-step verification&#8221; page that loads up, you will see a box that includes a blue button labeled &#8220;Start setup &gt;&gt;&#8221;. Click on that button.</span></li>
<li><b></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> At this point, Google will likely prompt you to resubmit your login credentials. Enter your password and click the button &#8220;Sign in.&#8221;</span></li>
<li><b></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Enter your phone number into the available text field and click on one of the radio buttons to indicate whether you want to receive the verification codes via SMS text message or via call. Once Google has verified that you have entered your mobile phone number correctly (i.e. in the format (222) 555-5555), a blue button labeled &#8220;Send code&#8221; will become clickable at the bottom of your screen. Click that button.</span></li>
<li><b></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> A page will load saying that Google has sent you a code. You should receive a code from Google in the next few seconds either via SMS text message or call. Once you have received the six-digit code, enter it into the available text field and press the blue button &#8220;Verify.&#8221;</span></li>
<li><b></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Next, you will be asked whether Google should trust your computer. This is a setting that allows you to elevate the privilege status of your computer, tablet, or mobile phone so that you don&#8217;t have to enter in verification codes when logging into your Google account on that device. A clickable box will appear that will enable you to check off whether you want to trust the device. Check the box ONLY if the device belongs to you and it is not a public device or computer. When you are done, click the blue button labeled &#8220;Next.&#8221;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Click the blue button labeled &#8220;Confirm&#8221; to finish turning on two-step verification on your Google account.</span></li>
<li><b></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> And you&#8217;re done! You will be redirected to a page where you can manage the settings of your two-step verification protection feature. On this page, you can edit your pre-verified phone number, create app-specific passwords, manage your registered (i.e. trusted) computers, or even designate a security key if you are using Google&#8217;s Chrome browser. (NOTE: Now that you have set up 2SV on your account, a boxed feature to the right of your screen will list the feature as &#8220;On.&#8221;)</span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can also set up a back-up phone and print out or save backup codes that allow you to access your account in the event that you lose your device.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is STRONGLY recommended that you set up at least one of these two backup settings.</span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="13">
<li><b></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Now whenever you sign into your Google account, you will see this screen after you enter in your password.</span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Simply enter in the code once you receive it via SMS text message or call. If the code is correct, you will automatically be directed to your account.</span></p>

        <hr />        <h1> Protecting Twitter with Login Verification </h1>
        <p> Published Date : September 8, 2016<br />Author : tayo<br /><p style="text-align: justify;"><span class="_Tgc"><img class="aligncenter " src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/IsdvJI0AK5M/hqdefault.jpg" alt="" width="444" height="333" /></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span class="_Tgc"> <b>2</b>&#8211;<b>Step Verification</b> is an extra layer of security for your Twitter account. Instead of only entering a password to log in, you’ll also enter a code which is sent via text message to your mobile phone. This verification helps make sure that you, and only you, can access your account.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Twitter implementation of 2SV is called &#8220;Login Verification&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To get started, follow these steps:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>SMS login verification</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">1. Log in to your Twitter account via a web browser.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">2. At the top-right corner of your Twitter homepage, you will find a box-like icon that displays either your profile image or an egg against a colored background (in the event you have not uploaded an image). If you hover over that icon, the text &#8220;Profile and Settings&#8221; will drop down just below it. Click on that icon.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-345 size-full" src="http://178.62.60.23/wordpress/security-guide/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Screenshot-from-2016-10-07-131714-1.png" alt="Screenshot from 2016-10-07 13:17:14" width="434" height="232" srcset="http://178.62.60.23/wordpress/security-guide/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Screenshot-from-2016-10-07-131714-1.png 434w, http://178.62.60.23/wordpress/security-guide/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Screenshot-from-2016-10-07-131714-1-250x134.png 250w, http://178.62.60.23/wordpress/security-guide/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Screenshot-from-2016-10-07-131714-1-120x64.png 120w" sizes="(max-width: 434px) 100vw, 434px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">3. A dropdown menu containing your name, your lists, and a number of other features will appear. Just above &#8220;Log out,&#8221; which should be the last feature in the menu, you will find &#8220;Settings.&#8221; Click on that option.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">4. You will find yourself on your account overview page, which displays your Twitter handle, your registered email, and some other basic pieces of information about your account.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">On the left-hand side of the page, you will see a menu with &#8220;Account&#8221; selected in bold font. Click on &#8220;Security and privacy&#8221; located just beneath the &#8220;Account&#8221; option on that list.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-348 size-full" src="http://178.62.60.23/wordpress/security-guide/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Screenshot-from-2016-10-07-131902.png" alt="Screenshot from 2016-10-07 13:19:02" width="332" height="210" srcset="http://178.62.60.23/wordpress/security-guide/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Screenshot-from-2016-10-07-131902.png 332w, http://178.62.60.23/wordpress/security-guide/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Screenshot-from-2016-10-07-131902-250x158.png 250w, http://178.62.60.23/wordpress/security-guide/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Screenshot-from-2016-10-07-131902-120x76.png 120w" sizes="(max-width: 332px) 100vw, 332px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">5. The first item under the &#8220;Security&#8221; section of the page is named &#8220;Login verification.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Next to that title, you will see an unchecked box with the text &#8220;Verify login requests&#8221; displayed next to it. Click on that box.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-364 size-full" src="http://178.62.60.23/wordpress/security-guide/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Screenshot-from-2016-10-07-131931.png" alt="Screenshot from 2016-10-07 13:19:31" width="631" height="328" srcset="http://178.62.60.23/wordpress/security-guide/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Screenshot-from-2016-10-07-131931.png 631w, http://178.62.60.23/wordpress/security-guide/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Screenshot-from-2016-10-07-131931-250x130.png 250w, http://178.62.60.23/wordpress/security-guide/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Screenshot-from-2016-10-07-131931-120x62.png 120w" sizes="(max-width: 631px) 100vw, 631px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">6. A dialog window will appear. It will state that you must receive a test message on your phone before you can activate login verification via SMS. Click on the blue button &#8220;Okay, send me a message.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>NOTE</strong>: This message will display only if you have previously verified both your account and a valid mobile phone number with Twitter. If you have not already done so, go back to &#8220;Account&#8221; on the left-hand sidebar list and complete those steps.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">7. If your mobile settings are correct, you should have received a text message to your phone that reads, &#8220;Twitter can send verification codes to this device!&#8221; Click the &#8220;Yes&#8221; button in your web browser to confirm that you received that code.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">8. A new dialog box asks you to reenter your password in order to save your new account preferences. Enter in your password and click the button &#8220;Save changes.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">9. Your account is now protected with SMS login verification! A message at the top of your &#8220;Security and Privacy&#8221; page will confirm that your settings have been saved. You will also see that the &#8220;Verify login requests&#8221; box is now checked.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Twitter app login verification</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">1. If you have not already done so, download the Twitter app on your mobile device. Once the download is complete, set up your account in the app.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">2. On your Android device, tap the overflow icon, which should look like three dots displayed vertically, at the top of Twitter app&#8217;s homepage. (On an iOS device, click on the gear icon.)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">3. In the dropdown menu that appears, click on the &#8220;Settings&#8221; option.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">4. A list of settings will appear below your Twitter handle. Click on &#8220;Account.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">5. Your Account page will display your registered phone number and email. It will also give you the option to change your password and review your security settings. Click on &#8220;Security.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">6. On your Android device, click on the unfilled box that sits adjacent to the &#8220;Login verification&#8221; option. (For iOS devices, you will need to flip a Login verification switch to &#8220;On.&#8221;)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">7. A dialog box will open up alerting you to the fact that you will need your device in order to log into your Twitter account from now on. Click &#8220;OK.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">8. At that point, you&#8217;ll be redirected to a screen where the Twitter app will ask you to take a screenshot of a backup code for your Twitter account. It is very important that you remember this code in case you lose your device. Take a screenshot of the code or write it down and store it somewhere safe.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">9. And you&#8217;re done! The next time you log into your Twitter account from a web browser, your computer will display a screen indicating that it has sent you a verification request to your Twitter app.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Click on the checkmark to verify your login access, and you will automatically be redirected to your home feed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you do not receive the verification request, you can also have Twitter send your mobile device an SMS code. If that doesn&#8217;t work, you can use your backup code to log in.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There you have it! Your Twitter account is now protected with 2SV, and you can receive verification codes either via SMS text messaging or via Twitter&#8217;s mobile app.</p>
<p><strong>To disable login verification:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Go to your <a href="http://twitter.com/settings/security">Security and privacy settings</a> and deselect the <strong>Verify login requests</strong> option.</li>
<li>Save changes (<strong>Note:</strong> you&#8217;ll have to enter your password).</li>
</ol>

        <hr />        <h1> Understanding the Risks in Geo Tagging </h1>
        <p> Published Date : October 27, 2016<br />Author : tayo<br /><p style="text-align: justify;"><img src="http://asianjournal.com/news/wp-content/blogs.dir/2/files/2013/09/Demo_Mkt-Analysis-655x435.jpg" alt="" width="589" height="391" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Geo tagging feature is, an awesome way of letting people know where you had that delightful lunch with your family, or the beautiful view from your room during a holiday trip. It just makes it easier for you to arrange photos and let friends know where they might be able to replicate some enjoyable experience you had.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With its interesting capabilities, there is also risk to consider when using the Geo tag feature.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The primary risk with geo tag is the risk of “<strong>social surveillance.</strong>”  If you’ve any social media platform, be it Facebook? Twitter or Instagram. You must have come across social stalkers.  These modern creepers make use of the information you publish on social media pages in order to track your movement, your habits, and your associations.  Stalkers can make use of public geo tagging information to pinpoint your present location, find out where you live, and even how and where you spend your time with very little effort.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The follow points are best ways to keep you safe while geo tagging.</p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li><strong>Take the time to note your default privacy settings: </strong>This applies both to your smart phone or mobile device and the social media networks you access through your device.   Sometimes tagging a location maybe a default setting on your phone or on the social network you’re using.  It is important to be aware of these settings so you can consciously decide when and where you geo tag, and who the information will be available to.</li>
<li><strong>Understand the Risk:  </strong>Realize that geo tagging information gives anyone who views it the opportunity to know your exact whereabouts, particularly in instances where you’ve posted your location to multiple sites (e.g. Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram).  A check-in at the airport with the message “vacation for the next week!” for example lets anyone who might care to look know that you’ll be out of town for a week.</li>
<li><strong>Know How to Disable the Geo Tagging Feature: </strong>Every smartphone has a geo tag feature, and many of them will be automatically set up to function without you consciously choosing to have it do so. It’s a much better idea to consciously decide to geo tag each time you post rather than having to remember to opt out of geo tagging each time you post</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>How To Disable Geo Tagging Feature</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>For iPhones</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Go to the “settings” page of the geo-tagging program.  Go to “settings” then “general” and then “location services.”  Disable those applications that automatically make use of your GPS tracking data.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class="aligncenter " src="http://cdn.osxdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/disable-gps-location-tags-iphone-photos.jpg" alt="" width="302" height="536" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>For Android Platforms:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Start the camera application.  Open the menu and go to “settings.”  Turn off “geo tagging” or “location storage” (depending on the type of Android).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For digital cameras, be sure to consult the user manual.  Not all digital cameras come with a geo tagging feature, but it’s important you know how your particular camera operates in relation to location tracking.</p>

        <hr />        <h1> using twitter safely </h1>
        <p> Published Date : September 8, 2016<br />Author : tayo<br /><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">As with any social network, Twitter is vulnerable to over sharing, data leakage and unintended consequences.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like Facebook and Google, Twitter is also driven by ad revenue so it’s very interested in what its users are up to when they’re using Twitter and when they aren’t (you did realise that </span><a href="https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2013/12/11/how-twitter-tracks-the-websites-you-visit-and-how-to-stop-it/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Twitter tracks the websites you visit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> didn’t you?).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">First things first. You’ll find the privacy settings at twitter.com under the gear icon, then Settings.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then click Security and privacy over on the menu to the left of your screen.</span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><b>Twitter’s security settings</b></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first section is about Security and how you access your Twitter account.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><b>LOGIN VERIFICATION.</b></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is set by default to off. Make it harder for an unauthorised person to login to your account, by choosing to receive login verification requests via a text message on your phone or the Twitter mobile app.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class="aligncenter " src="http://images.techhive.com/images/article/2013/10/login_verification-100058670-orig.png" alt="" width="400" height="238" /></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><b>PASSWORD RESET.</b></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Set by default to off, you only need to enter your Twitter username.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Check the Require personal information to reset my password so that two factors are required and, most importantly, so you can avoid reset emails and get a code sent by SMS to your phone instead.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://sophosnews.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/twitter-privacy-security-reset-password.jpg?w=640" alt="" width="500" height="120" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Twitter’s privacy settings</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The second section is about how private you choose to make your Twitter account.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><b>PHOTO TAGGING.</b></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like Facebook, others can tag you in a photo, which is just like a ‘mention’ on Twitter – you get ‘mentioned’ in the uploaded photo.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is set by default to on, meaning anyone can tag you in a photo. Use the radio buttons to restrict tagging to people you follow back, or disable photo tagging altogether.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://sophosnews.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/twitter-privacy.jpg?w=640" alt="" width="500" height="309" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://sophosnews.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/twitter-privacy-security-photo-tagging.jpg?w=640" alt="" width="500" height="119" /></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><b>TWEET PRIVACY.</b></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">By default, Protect my Tweets is off, and anyone on Twitter, all your followers, and anyone searching Google can see your tweets. If you check the box to protect your Tweets, it locks down your visibility. A lot.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><b>TWEET LOCATION.</b></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is set as ‘off’ by default and you have to opt-in to use it. You can also specify before you tweet whether you want the location information on or off.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keep locations off, there are too many </span><a href="https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2014/01/28/take-the-3-step-privacy-plan-diet/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">unintended consequences</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and delete all past location information to be on the safe side.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://sophosnews.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/tweet-location-privacy-security.jpg?w=640" alt="" width="500" height="152" /></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><b>DISCOVERABILITY.</b></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let others find me by my email address is on by default and enables people who may not know your Twitter handle, but do know your email address, to find you.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apply the ‘principle of least privilege’ here. If you can think of a really good reason why you want to be discoverable by your email address (we can’t) then switch it on, otherwise turn it off.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://sophosnews.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/twitter-discoverabiity.jpg?w=640" alt="" width="500" height="67" /></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><b>PERSONALIZATION.</b></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Personalization is about tailoring suggestions of which accounts to follow, based on information that Twitter gathers about you around the internet.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can turn it off by unchecking the box next to Tailor Twitter based on my recent website visits.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><b>PROMOTED CONTENT.</b></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Twitter has ads. These are in the form of paid-for sponsored tweets, Twitter Cards, and promoted accounts. If you want Twitter to “bring you more useful and interesting advertising content”, you won’t uncheck this box.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Twitter has partnered with third party ‘behavioural advertising’ companies (behavioural ads are the ones that follow you around from website to website). If you visit a website that’s in of those advertisers’ networks then their ads can now follow you on to Twitter too.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The setting Tailor ads based on information shared by ad partners is on by default. Switch it off by unchecking the box.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can also disable personalization and promoted content by switching on Do Not Track in your browser. As we mentioned, Twitter has been honouring Do Not Track for a long time, and it </span><a href="https://support.twitter.com/articles/20170405#"><span style="font-weight: 400;">says in a support article</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, “When you have DNT enabled in your browser, Twitter would not receive browser-related information from our ads partners for tailoring ads.”</span></p>
